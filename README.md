Two codes to infer a weighted and directed network between a set of functional domains. 
Domains are computed using delta-MAPS and defined as semi-autonomous, spatially contiguous 
and possibly overlapping regions of the spatio-temporal field under investigation. 
Both network inferences codes take into account the strong autocorrelations of climate time series 
when testing for significance, however one of the two codes uses a simple t-test while the other 
code uses the False Discovery Rate. Using FDR allows to control (on average) the number of false positive.

Both codes are written in Mathematica.
